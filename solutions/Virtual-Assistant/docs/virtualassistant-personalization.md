# Personalizing a Virtual Assistant Demo

## Overview

While the Virtual Assistant Solution provides out-of-the-box functionality to demonstrate an end-to-end experience, it is often wise to customize key components that can tailor to your audience.
To get started, learn how to clone the repository & deploy your Azure resources by reading [Virtual Assistant Deployment](https://github.com/Microsoft/AI/blob/master/solutions/Virtual-Assistant/docs/virtualassistant-createvirtualassistant.md).

## Project Structure

The folder structure of your Virtual Assistant is shown below.

    | - Assistant                           // Directory for the core Virtual Assistant
        | - YOURBOT.bot                     // The .bot file containing all of your Bot configuration including dependencies
        | - README.md                       // README file containing links to documentation
        | - Program.cs                      // Default Program.cs file
        | - Startup.cs                      // Core Bot Initialisation including Bot Configuration LUIS, Dispatcher, etc.

            | - QnA                         // .LU files containing example QnA items
        | - DeploymentScripts               // msbot clone recipe for deployment
        | - Dialogs                         // Main dialogs sit under this directory

## Update the Introduction

When a new conversation is started with a Virtual Assistant, it receives a `ConversationUpdate` Activity and begins the `MainDialog`. 
The first Activity the Virtual Assistant will send displays an introduction card, which is found under [/assistant/Dialogs/Main/Resources](https://github.com/Microsoft/AI/tree/master/solutions/Virtual-Assistant/src/csharp/assistant/Dialogs/Main/Resources). 
The introduction is presented with an [Adaptive Card](https://adaptivecards.io/), where UX elements can be defined once and rendered appropriate to your client. You can copy the JSON below and paste in in [Adaptive Cards Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) to experiment with yourself.

## Update the FAQ with QnAMaker

The FAQ provided features commonly asked questions about the Bot Framework, but you may wish to provide industry-specific samples.

To update an existing QnAMaker Knowledge Base, perform the following steps:
1. Make changes to your QnAMaker Knowledge Base via the [LuDown](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/Ludown) and [QnAMaker](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/QnAMaker) CLI tools or the [QnAMaker Portal](https://qnamaker.ai).
2. Run the following command to update your Dispatch model to reflect your changes (ensures proper message routing):
```shell
    dispatch refresh --bot "YOURBOT.bot" --secret YOURSECRET
```

## Demoing the Skills

You can review a sample transcript showcasing the Productivity & Point of Interest Skills [here](transcripts/skillsdemo.transcript), 
which can be opened in the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/wiki).
This sample conversation shows a user having previously [linked their account](/virtualassistant-linkedaccounts.md) and taking advantage of [event debug middleware](/virtualassistant-events.md).
