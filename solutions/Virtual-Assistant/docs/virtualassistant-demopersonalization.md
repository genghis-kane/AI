![Virtual Assistant Introduction Card](media/virtualAssistant-introductionCard.png)

When a new conversation is started with a Virtual Assistant, it receives a `ConversationUpdate` Activity and begins the `MainDialog`. 
The first Activity the Virtual Assistant will send displays an introduction card, which can be found under [assistant/Dialogs/Main/Resources](https://github.com/Microsoft/AI/tree/master/solutions/Virtual-Assistant/src/csharp/assistant/Dialogs/Main/Resources). The intro card is an Adaptive Card, meaning it is flexible while being defined in a simple schema. To learn more about Adaptive Cards, visit their offical documentation [here](https://adaptivecards.io/).
